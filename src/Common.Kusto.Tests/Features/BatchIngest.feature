Feature: BatchIngest
As a user,
I want to be able to ingest json files in batch to kusto database,
So that I can query them later.

  Scenario: batch ingest json files
    Given json file folder "TestData"
    When Ensure kusto table "People" exists
    When I ingest json files
    Then kusto db should have table "People"
    And table "People" should have 10 rows
